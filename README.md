# Employee Polls App - React and Redux

This web app is for creating polls for coworkers where an employee can post a scenario question with 2 possible responses and then other employees respond. Employees can then vote on these responses and see which have the most votes. The goal is to improve collaboration and transparency within the company. The web app will provide a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls theyâ€™ve created and answered. The app used React to render UI and used Redux to manage global state and pass data through the UI.
